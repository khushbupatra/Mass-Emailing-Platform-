# Mass-emailing-using-AWS
This project intends to send bulk emails to a list of recipients. To build a cost-efficient serverless mass mailing platform, you can integrate AWS Lambda with Simple Email Service (SES), S3, and DynamoDB. When a PDF file is uploaded to the system, it will activate an S3 event.
